# Purpose

This tool takes an OpenAPI specification file and generates some word tables.
These tables are dedicated to be part of IEC 63278-5.

The specifications can be found here:

https://industrialdigitaltwin.io/aas-specifications/IDTA-01002/v3.1.1/http-rest-api/http-rest-api.html#_general

The specifications shall be exported as YAML, resolved.

For a correct generation, YAML config files are required, as well.
